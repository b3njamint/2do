## What this repository is (vue tutorial? Firebase tutorial?) and specifically what it does.
### a. So a bad readme would just say "this is a vue tutorial" while a good readme would say "this is a vue tutorial. In the tutorial, I create a website that lists recipes and sorts them by ingredients needed." b. Additionally, screenshots of your work is greatly appreciated if possible

This is a React and Firebase tutorial. It is a todo list built in React with a login system using Firebase Authentication, and stores user data in the Realtime Database.

We start by registering an account. If we mess up and our emails or passwords do not match, then a popup is shown. In this case, the email is "email@email.com" but the confirm email is "email2@gmail.com", which do not match.

If we log out and log back in, our todo list is still there! This way, many people can use this todo list and each person's changes will not affect others.

We can also delete completed tasks.

My next steps will be to use Express to write my own functions to retrieve, add, and delete from the database. 

## Why you are doing this tutorial (2-3 sentences will suffice)!
